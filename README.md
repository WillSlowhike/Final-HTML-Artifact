# Final HTML Artifact
 you will build two web pages that show you have a solid grasp of HTML. I am expecting you are able to CREATE something, to show you understand the content beyond the basics and that you can apply what you've learned. You can reference notes, look at files, or google things but you should not copy and paste code or get help from a peer.
